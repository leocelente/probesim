# Path is integrated to meters in a flat plane.
# which is equivalent to a ENU or Local Tangent Plane
# it is defined through geodesic latitude and longitude
# so to view it correctly on a map, its also necessary
# to convert it to geocentric latitude. 
# METERS (ENU) -> LAT/LNG (GEODETIC) -> LAT/LNG (ECEF)
